# Browser fingerprint generation in React

> using [fingerprintJS](https://fingerprint.com/)

## Environment Variables

This project uses Vite. Vite requires you to prefix your environment variables with `VITE_` to be able to expose to the frontend. Variables which are only to be used at the backend, don't need a prefix.

Create a `.env` file at the root of the project where you can set your environment variables. An example env file has already been created for you (`.env.example`).

## Run locally

It will be live at port `5000`.
